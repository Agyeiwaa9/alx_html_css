        <h3>Why I joined ALX</h3>
        <p> Prior to going to being admitted to the university, I always had interest in software engineering. However this was not what I studied at the University as can be deduced from my profile. 
            I did not give up on my dreams. A chanced on AlX through a link shared by a friend and that's how it started. The journey so far has been all sorts of tastes but interesting.</p>
