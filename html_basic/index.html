        <h3>Why I joined ALX</h3>
        <p> Prior to going to being admitted to the university, I always had interest in software engineering. However this was not what I studied at the University as can be deduced from my profile. 
            I did not give up on my dreams. I chanced on ALX through <a href="https://tech.alxafrica.com/ghana?utm_source=Social+Media&utm_medium=Bio&utm_campaign=Sign-Ups"> link </a> shared by a friend and that's how it started. The journey so far has been all sorts of tastes but interesting.I agree with Emiko😂</p>
